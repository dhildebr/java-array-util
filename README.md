These are some old Java array utility functions I wrote back in 2015. The aim here is to facilitate similar functionality in the language's inbuilt arrays as that seen in ArrayList, albeit in a somewhat less object-oriented manner.

The code is released under the [BSD 3-cause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). Refer to [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) I'd prefer if my code weren't used in any missile systems, but I'm not going to actually put the force of law behind that part.
